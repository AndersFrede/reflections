When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If you want to share your work with others.
- If you want to access it from another computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- If others are adding to the remote repository, but you want to review the changes before adding them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks create a copy of another users repository on GitHub.
- Clones create a copy of your own repository either from GitHub or locally.
- Branches create new commit routes that can be used for experimental work etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- You can work on it offline.
- You can quickly discover the most recent changes to the remote, when you get back online.
