What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- It creates the .git folder, where git commits will be placed.
- If a git repository is not initialized, it will not be possible to create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area contains files in a sort of limbo. They aren't untracked anymore, but they haven't had commits attached to them yet either.
- It allows more control over which files are tracked with commits.
